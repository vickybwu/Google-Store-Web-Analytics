# Google-Store-Web-Analytics

## This is a project from my Web Analytics course. The goal of this project is to simulate the process of analyzing an online business's web performance. As we know, most online businesses use an analytical tool like Google analytics, Amazon Advertising Campaigns, Crazy Egg, KISSmetrics, etc. to analyze and optimize their performance by looking at critical metrics like website traffic, engagement and conversion.

### Since I don't have an online store myself, I downloaded the Google Merchandise Store's Dec. 2018 performance and analyzed the store's Traffic Sources, Bounce Rate, Engagement, Conversions, Audience Demographics and Audience Behavior by Devices. 

### I created data visualization in R with some basic plots and a map of user locations using the package maptools.

### The analysis was then put into a dashboard-looking report with Actionable Insights (just throwing buzzwords here) 

#### Here is a screenshot of one section of the report, to view full report, click the PDF file "Google Merchandise Store Web Analytics"
